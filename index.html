            This is my story of being a Mom to Coder Mom!. I want to share my story how my journey made me from a home mom to a Student mom and finally to Coder mom.
            I also wanted to make others to think that they can do whenever and whatever they want. 
            But we have to keep going by having positive thinking by not giving up!.

         <p>Coding is a different World for me, because I have never coded in my life. At the begining I thougth I couldn't do it.
         There are a lot more to learn.And now, I am so excited that I can Code.I want to show this to my Family. Being a mom and a student not a 
         easy job. But to be sucess we have to move forward with out letting down and loosing hope.
         Also I never thougth I would be a student again after 14 years, that makes me think iam back to my olden days. Which makes feel proud of myself.
         I wanted to encourage my Family and Friends by sharing my story about being a "CODER MOM!".
